about: "Professionally, I have the most experience with [C++](https://isocpp.org) after graduating university and spending 2 years in the games industry working with the [Unreal Engine](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/). Personally, however, my favourite language is [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/) as I have a keen interest in the applications and methods of adopting the [functional paradigm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming) in games. 


Currently, I am captivated by [Nix Ecosystem](https://nixos.org/) and enjoying the use of declarative tooling for my personal projects. At work, I am trying to work on my management and leadership skills in an effort to reach the next step of my career. 


Regardless of experience, I will always consider myself a beginner. It's my way of keeping an open mind about the software patterns and technologies I'm yet to discover."
