description-detail: |
  Professionally, I have the most experience with [C++](https://isocpp.org) after graduating university and spending 2 years in the games industry working with the [Unreal Engine](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/). Personally, however, my favourite language is [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/) as I have a keen interest in the applications and methods of adopting the [functional paradigm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming) in the context of video games.

  [Jagex](https://www.jagex.com/en-GB/), a company I dreamed of working for when I was a child, finally opened its (virtual and fully-remote) doors to me in [2021](/blog/hello-jagex/). We were working on an MMORPG, a genre I was excited to work with due to having spent (and wasted) countless hours in many MMORPGs throughout my life.


  After working on an asynchronous team like mine, I learned how important communication was and what my best methods of communication were. My confidence grew tremendously as I was relied upon as a bridge between design and engineering; solving technical problems while designing a fun experience for players. I can't thank Jagex enough for these opportunities --- I truly feel like my career has fast-forwarded!

  When I came out of university and got interviewed to join [Deep Silver Dambuster Studios](https://www.dsdambuster.com/), I had no idea that I would be working on the next [TimeSplitters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TimeSplitters) game. I was overwhelmed with excitement to see how the newest entry would turn out.


  This was my first job in the games industry and I'm very grateful for the opportunities presented to me while working there. I became proficient in working with [Unreal Engine 4 and 5](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/) while also learning to work with other disciplines towards a shared goal.
