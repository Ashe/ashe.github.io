# A post about this website!

Hey everyone! So this is my first 'meta' post which indicates that this blog post is related to my blog itself!

I can't believe I hadn't heard of it before, but [dev.to](https://dev.to) is an incredible place filled with rich content written by developers just like myself! I've been reading and learning a few new things there the past few days, and figured that it's time to join them. You can find my profile at [dev.to/ashe](https://dev.to/ashe).

[I've set up my RSS feed](/rss.xml) not only so that RSS readers have access to my content, but also so that I can pull my posts from my site onto [dev.to](https://dev.to). This means that I have a good starting point when it comes to formatting my posts and preparing them for cross-posting. The workflow is really nice, and although it could be better if I managed to get the [GitHub action 'publish to dev.to'](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/publish-to-dev-to) working, I don't write a lot and having an opportunity to manually adjust content before posting feels good to me.

I'm hoping that cross-posting my content both introduces people to who I am and what I do and what I'm about, while also giving me a chance to produce more/better content as my blogging career continues. Even though I am talking about [dev.to](https://dev.to), my priority is and always will be my private space of the internet, [aas.sh](https://aas.sh). Posts will always be written here (or there, depending on where you're reading this!) first, and then I'll cross-post shortly after. 

I will say that I have some hand-crafted things for my website, such as captions and galleries, and so readers on [dev.to](https://dev.to) may not be able to experience the same things. That said, if you're on [dev.to](https://dev.to) then you'll be accustomed and potentially even fond of the consistent and streamlined styling across all content on the site, so I'm sure this isn't a problem.

And that's about it for today's post --- I don't want to drag this out to be longer than necessary! Like I said in [my last post](/blog/4-months-at-jagex), expect to see some new posts coming soon related to **[Outer Wilds](https://store.steampowered.com/app/753640/Outer_Wilds/)** and **[NixOS](https://nixos.org/)**, as well as (hopefully) **a brand new page on the website that's like a roadmap of my life**.

And if you're reading this from [dev.to](https://dev.to), welcome!
