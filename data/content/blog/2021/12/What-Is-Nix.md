Before I touched Haskell, I felt pretty savvy about using [CMake](https://cmake.org/) for my C++ projects. My mind started expanding as I started to learn both functional programming and the tools that work declartively. I hope that this post is a good introduction to the world of Nix for beginners.

# The build tool evolution

Typically when working with Haskell, you'd use something like [Stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/) or [Cabal](https://www.haskell.org/cabal/) to declare dependencies and build the project. This works great most of the time, but sometimes they feel like the thorn that makes me reconsider using Haskell. 

I started off with [Stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/) since that's what most tutorials have you install when you're a beginner (with good reason too, as it is very nice). However, before Stack there was [Cabal](https://www.haskell.org/cabal/) which is a lot simpler than Stack and focused on resolving dependencies. Stack introduces things like better project templates, caching of built packages and finally usage of [Stackage](https://www.stackage.org/) to pull dependencies. 

:::{.note header="Cabal vs cabal-install"}
When we mention 'cabal' there are actually two things we could be referring to: the **library** or the **build tool** `cabal-install`. The library is *used* by Stack to help resolve dependencies, meanwhile `cabal-install` is *replaced* by Stack. `cabal-install` pulls dependencies straight from [Hackage](https://hackage.haskell.org/) whereas Stack pulls from [Stackage](https://ww.stackage.org). Stackage one-ups Hackage in usage because the packages are curated to make sure dependencies work with each other (**St**able H**ackage**).

# Enter Nix

There exists yet another build tool: [Nix](https://nixos.org/). The easiest way to describe it is that Nix is like Stack except *not just for Haskell*. Stack is built very intelligently, keeping different versions of dependencies separate from one another while also keeping track of what's compatible. 

Take C++ development for example --- typically, you have to download dependencies and manage them yourself. You might put them in a centralised place on your machine so that all of your programs can find them, but then you force other people to have to put them in the same place. You might consider bundling them with your project as a [git submodule](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules), but then you're requiring users to download all your dependencies even if they already have them on their machines (possibly incurring additional compilation times too). Maybe you have a tool that intelligently searches for the locations of these dependencies, but then you're requiring users to depend on that tool as well. Even if you're a solo developer, ***you are a user of your own work***.

In this regard, Stack (along with other build tools like [Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/) for [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) is a brilliant improvement on this workflow. However, then you need to install each of these build tools for each of the languages your to-be-built programs and libraries use.

This is where Nix comes in. While sometimes these tools cannot be avoided, they can at least be automated. When using Nix, all of these programs can be built, used and depended-on in the exact same way, while keeping the benefits of reproducability (or *bringing*, if the old build tools didn't do these things first).

> [Nix](https://nixos.org/) is a reproducable, declarative and reliable way of building and deploying software.

* **Reproducible:** Nix builds packages in isolation from each other. This ensures that they are reproducible and don't have undeclared dependencies, so **if a package works on one machine, it will also work on another**.
* **Declarative:** Nix makes it **trivial to share development and build environments** for your projects, regardless of what programming languages and tools youâ€™re using.
* **Reliable:** Nix ensures that installing or upgrading one package **cannot break other packages**. It allows **you to roll back to previous versions**, and ensures that no package is in an inconsistent state during an upgrade.

When you use Nix, you don't need to manually install anything related to your project. I have no traces of Rust or C++ on my machine since the only time I need them is during a project where I can let Nix do the heavy lifting. It really is wonderful when you type `nix develop` and all of a sudden your shell becomes capable of building, testing and running your work. It's beautiful.

I'll probably write some tutorials about Nix at some point, but I'm still learning it myself and have yet to actually submit a package to the ecosystem. I just wanted to participate in some evangelism and mention it on my website.
