# Background

While I have had a website for many years now, this particular iteration has a new meaning in the sense that I am finally happy with the appearance and featureset of the website as a whole. I feel like even though there's tweaks to be made and pages to be added, this is probably the way it's going to be for a very long time, and I'm proud of how things have come out!

# Credit

Massive thanks to [Yannik Sander](https://ysndr.de) for both inspiring me to switch to using [Hakyll](https://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/) and giving me a good base to start from when it came to recreating my website. You can find his website over at [https://ysndr.de](https://ysndr.de), where he too writes blogs about [Nix](https://nixos.org/). I'm not a designer and so when I saw Yannik's visual style I was so impressed, and then I realised how he used Hakyll for a pleasurable blogging experience. I can't thank him enough since without his impressive website, I wouldn't have had the motivation nor the starting point to work on this.

# Updates

Since the website is very much an ongoing thing, it is probably not a good use of my time to put information on this page that will go out of date. Instead, I implemented a 'project post' feature where posts can be linked to a project rather than existing as a regular post. Below, you will find posts that detail any changes that are made to the website.
