# Background

While I have had a website for many years now, this particular iteration has a new meaning in the sense that I am finally happy with the appearance and featureset of the website as a whole. I feel like even though there's tweaks to be made and pages to be added, this is probably the way it's going to be for a very long time, and I'm proud of how things have come out!

# Updates

Since the website is very much an ongoing thing, it is probably not a good use of my time to put information on this page that will go out of date. Instead, I implemented a 'project post' feature where posts can be linked to a project rather than existing as a regular post. Below, you will find posts that detail any changes that are made to the website.
